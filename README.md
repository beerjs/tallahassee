Beer.js Tallahassee
===================

Beer.js Tallahassee is a welcoming get-together for everyone who wants to learn about JavaScript. 
We meet the first Tuesday of the month. 
That's all the planning we have: whoever shows up decides what happens.

Our next meet up will be at `6:00 PM ET on Tuesday, March 1, 2016 @ Krewe de Gras` (1304 N Monroe St, Tallahassee, FL 32303). Look for the guy wearing the bright orange Handlebars.js t-shirt... That'll be Steve.  He'll have a beer waiting for you!

Please note, Beer.js Tallahassee happens at a bar and will require valid photo identification (Drivers License, Passport, etc) to enter.  Don't forget yours! Attendees pay for their own food and drinks!  (The conversation is free, everything else you have to pay for.)

Why Beer.js Tallahassee?
------------------------

- We welcome JavaScripters of all experience levels, including complete beginners, who seek to learn and meet new friends. 

- We do no more planning than needed: come with your own questions or ready to answer others’. 

- We are not interested in sponsors, recruiters, or pitches. Leave your company affiliation at the door and come learn with us. To make this a reality, we consciously eliminate any financial dependence or any use the group might have for outsiders. That’s why we meet in free, public places, don't have speakers or planned events, and don't have any online communication, other than this repo and our Meetup group (http://www.meetup.com/beerjs-tallahassee).
