February 2, 2016 - Beer.js Recap @ Krewe
========================================

4 people attended our first Beer.js meetup since the short haitus due to the birth of my son.

For the most part, we stayed on-topic and our conversations revolved around (in no particular order):  

* NativeScript  
* React Native  
* Highcharts/Highmaps  
* Learning Angular 2  
* Electron  
* Docker  

Thanks to those who came...  Hope to meet everyone else at future events!
