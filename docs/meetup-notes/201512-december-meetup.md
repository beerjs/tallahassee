December 1, 2015 - Beer.js Recap @ Krewe
========================================

5 people attended our first Beer.js meetup.

For the most part, we stayed on-topic and our conversations revolved around (in no particular order):  

* Polymer (And it's Shadow DOM) vs React  
* Creating Hybrid Apps (Ionic/PhoneGap)  
* Xamarin  
* Atomic CSS  
* HTML5 Service Worker  
* JavaScript Revealing Module Pattern  
* Visual Studio's Git Integration  
* Executing Shell Scripts in Node  
* A possible group project with JS and Raspberry Pi  

Thanks to those who came...  Hope to meet everyone else at future events!
